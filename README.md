Objective
BoomBikes, a US-based ride-sharing company, aimed to predict the demand for shared bikes post-Covid-19 lockdown to optimize service efficiency. The company sought to understand which variables significantly impact bike demand and how these variables explain demand fluctuations.

Problem Statement
BoomBikes have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

Submissions Expected:
Python Notebook: One Python notebook with the whole linear model, predictions, and evaluation.
